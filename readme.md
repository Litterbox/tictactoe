#Week 1 Project - Tic Tac Toe

**Objective:** Build a tic taco game in HTML and pure javascript.

This week we have been learning about writing functions, working with loops, and writing conditionals. We also learned about how parts of HTML work and function.

Today we will be making a Tic Tac Toe game using all of this.

## Minimum Requirements
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
* Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`
* Upon marking of an individual cell, use javascript to add a class to each cell to display separate colors.
* A cell should not be able able to replayed once marked.
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.

##Bonus
* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
* After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row.
  * Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move.
